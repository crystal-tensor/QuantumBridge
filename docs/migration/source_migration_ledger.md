# Source Migration Ledger

Status: Stage 5.5 P1 RC baseline  
Date: 2026-06-04  

This ledger records implementation mode and upstream source status for the current P1 release-candidate baseline. Current work uses Native Implementation, Adapter Integration, and Upstream Dependency. No new upstream source migration was introduced during Stage 5.5. No Source Port with Attribution was performed.
